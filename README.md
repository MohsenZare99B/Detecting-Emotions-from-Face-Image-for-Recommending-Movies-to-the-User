# Detecting Emotions from Face Image for Recommending Movies to the User


A lot of the time, our decisions are affected by our emotions and mood. If we are upset, we lean towards certain activities, whereas if we are excited, we desire other activities. Our choice of watching which movie can also be influenced by our emotions. For example, when we are sad, we prefer certain types of movies that differ from the ones we prefer when we are happy.

In this project, I have designed and implemented a system that detects the emotional state of its user based on the photograph of their face and, in response, recommends some movies that match their emotions. This project offers other features, such as navigating between movie lists. Moreover, users can rate different movies based on their genre (horror, romance, etc.) so that by viewing othersâ€™ ratings, they can get some idea about the movies. Also after authentication, users can leave comments on movies. I have used deep learning methods for detecting emotional states based on the input photograph, and for the movie recommender phase, I have utilized reinforcement learning and matrix factorization. I have designed and implemented the system in the form of a website. I used Django for implementing this website and for the deep learning part, I used TensorFlow. I did this project as my B.Sc. project.
